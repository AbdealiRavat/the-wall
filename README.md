The Wall is a Flutter application that provides a platform for users to share messages on a public wall. It includes features such as authentication, a profile page, posting messages to the wall, and displaying posts from other users.

## Features

### Authentication

The Wall app has a user authentication system that allows users to create an account or log in using their existing credentials. The authentication process ensures secure access to the app's features and personalization of the user experience.

### Profile Page

Each user has their own profile page where they can view and edit their personal information. The profile page includes details such as the user's name, profile picture, and any additional information they choose to provide.

### Posting Messages

Users can post messages on the public wall, sharing their thoughts, updates, or any other content they wish to share with others. The app provides a simple and intuitive interface for composing and submitting messages to be displayed on the wall.

### Displaying Other Users' Posts

The Wall app features a feed that displays posts from other users. Users can scroll through the feed to view the messages shared by others. Each post typically includes the username or profile picture of the user who made the post, along with the content of the message.
